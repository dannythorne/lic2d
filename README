Type 'make' to compile the code.

Place an LB2D_Prime velocity dat file in the dat folder and edit it as follows:
Add one line at the top of the file containing LX followed by LY. See the
example ./dat/u299x299_frame0036_subs00.dat .

Then run ./lic.exe ./dat/u299x299_frame0036_subs00.dat

It will create an lic_in.bmp file which is the input texture used to generate
the flow lines pattern that will be output in lic.bmp .
